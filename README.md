# Youtube Data Analytics
This personal project of mine is intended to help users fetch metadata (title, views, likes, comments, video category) from all 
uploaded videos of a youtube channel, and transfer them to a human-readable format in .csv

## Sample

Here is a quick demonstration ran on University Of Exeter's Youtube Channel.
