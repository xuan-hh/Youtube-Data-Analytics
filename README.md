# Youtube Data Analytics
This personal project of mine is intended to help users fetch metadata (title, views, likes, comments, video category) from all 
uploaded videos of a youtube channel, and transfer them to a human-readable format in .csv.

Feel free to experiment with the some of the functionalities and inputs to achieve the results you want.

Note the sample API key credentials in the code will NOT work. Please obtain your own API key from Youtube's Data API platform.
