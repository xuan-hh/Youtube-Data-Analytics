The University of Exeter study follows previous research which found that staring at seagulls makes them less likely to steal food.

Lead author Madeleine Goumas, of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall, explains more.

#BlueBeltSymposium 2019,"In July 2019, the University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus hosted the first ever UK Overseas Territories (UKOTs) Blue Belt Symposium, bringing together territory and UK governments and international organisations to discuss the opportunities and challenges in implementing the 'Blue Belt'.
 

The Blue Belt programme is an ambitious UK Government-led initiative which aims to provide long term protection and sustainable management of more than four million square kilometres of ocean across the UK and the UK Overseas Territories. 
Working in collaboration with the Territory Governments and informed by overseas experts, the programme has established some of the world’s largest marine protected areas across the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans.

With representatives from the majority of the 14 UK Overseas Territories, the University of Exeter, UK Government, and NGOs, the highly anticipated event brought together local and international experts and policy makers to discuss the challenges and opportunities in creating and managing the UK government's Blue Belt. 
The week was a great success with a series of talks and workshops sharing knowledge and experiences in creating and managing large-scale MPAs in the UKOTs (including keynote talks from those in the Big Ocean network).",477,7,0,0,"University of exeter,exeter uni,exeter university,student life,undergraduate,postgraduate,degree,studying,university life,#BlueBeltSymposium,Uk Gov Blue Belt,conference,UKOTs,Conservation,Marine"

Helping identify plagiarism with Seedata,"A forensic linguistics project developed with the University of Exeter and Seedata  could change the way plagiarism is detected in academia.

Plagiarism is a global issue for universities, and by using existing processes it can take up to a week for lecturers to detect issues with inconsistent results.

Dr Kate Harrington, a University of Exeter academic, worked with the Innovation, Impact and Business team to create new software which detects inauthentic authorship. By using forensic linguistic techniques, the software detects an author’s writing style and looks for consistency with previous works. Using this process, lecturers can then establish whether a student’s essays are written with the same ‘writing signature’ as their previous work.

Seedata, an Exeter-based SME and Science Park  tenant, have worked with the University to commercialise the IP and reduce the time taken to 4 seconds.

In addition to developing the idea, the new IP and software could lead to exciting business opportunities for Seedata.",76,0,0,0,"forensic linguistics,plagiarism,business development,software,IP"
Reducing energy costs with Minibems,"Minibems are an incubation success story at the University of Exeter, having recruited talented students, met new prospects, developed test facilities with researchers and successfully raised funding.

The Exeter-based SME provides an efficient, intelligent heating system to complex buildings which dramatically reduces energy costs, improves resident services and shortens repair times.

In order to develop their product, Minibems needed to test their system in a suitable environment. University of Exeter staff identified a suitable location on Streatham Campus, with degree apprentices helping to fit out the space.

Minibems have also benefited from working with SETsquared Exeter: after presenting at a SETsquared Investment Showcase, representatives from EDF approached the company and have since provided office space and valuable advice.",80,1,0,0,"energy,saving,SETsquared,incubation,acceleration,funding,research,heating"
£1 million funding helps Exeter firm address cow fertility crisis,"Agricultural engineering start-up, Milkalyser, has received £1 million of funding to further develop its innovative equipment that monitors the productivity of dairy cows.

Previously based in Exeter City Centre, and supported by the SETsquared Exeter initiative, Milkalyser is now moving onto pastures new with a wet lab and workshop space in Exeter Science Park Centre.

With the support of SETsquared Exeter, Milkalyser raised £1 million to develop their dairy cow management goals, including £500,000 funding from Mercia Fund Management, an early stage technology investor and another £500,000 grant from Innovate UK.

The funding is supporting the development of Milkalyser’s pre-production prototypes, with a goal of developing a data driven platform for farmers worldwide to maximise yields and profit.",72,0,0,0,"agritech,investment,farming,innovation,cows,business,support,SETsquared"

Lovelock Centenary Event Invite,"The Global Systems Institute is delighted to invite you to a conference on “The Future of Global Systems Thinking: Celebrating James Lovelock’s Centenary”, 29–31 July 2019 at the University of Exeter.

The event will celebrate the 100th birthday of James Lovelock by taking his pioneering approach to thinking about the Earth as a living system and exploring how we can apply it to help create a better future.

Lovelock’s quest to understand the whole earth system sparked the development of Earth System Science and stimulated a generation of environmental scientists. We invite all those who have been inspired or provoked by Lovelock’s work to come together to explore Earth system thinking, and how it can help a transition towards global sustainability.

The meeting will address the history and current state of Earth system thinking and approaches to applying it. This will include the concept of Gaia 2.0 which explores how humans may collectively add self-awareness to the Earth’s natural self-regulation systems. Gaia 2.0 is central to the Global Systems Institute which is a new interdisciplinary research, teaching, and engagement endeavour at the University of Exeter.

The conference will bring together representatives from across academic disciplines (science, engineering, social science, humanities and the arts) with organisations committed to transformations to environmental sustainability.

Jim Lovelock will be interviewed and do a question-and-answer session as part of the overall meeting. There will be keynote talks, panel discussions, break-out workshops and poster sessions for attendees to present their ideas. The conference takes place at the University of Exeter. Further details, including the conference programme, will be published soon.

Presentation abstract: This item of research explored the psychological impact of exposing international students to two distinct study spaces: an outgroup study space owned by white students (i.e., The Forum), and an in group study space owned by international students (i.e., INTO Building). Ultimately, we found that exposure to a study space influenced international student' academic performance, and this ""main effect"" was explained by an international student's willingness to adapt to British culture (i.e., acculturation attitudes).",502,13,0,0,"thesis,university,PhD,three minute thesis"

Presentation abstract: In the fight against ISIS, the level of cooperation between Kurds from different political parties across national borders has often been regarded as unprecedented. In my thesis however, I argue that this extensive cooperation is in fact not unprecedented at all. To illustrate this, I look at four key case studies where this cooperation was successful in furthering the Kurds “short-term ambitions as well as their overall long-term ambition“ Kurdish autonomy. The aim is to consider what will happen to the Kurds’ ambitions in Syria and Iraq, once ISIS has been fully defeated.",104,1,0,0,"Thesis,university,PhD,Three minute thesis"

Is mycoprotein as good for your muscles as animal protein?,"Animal protein is great for muscle building, but we know a lot less about sustainably produced non-animal derived proteins. 
 
Mycoprotein is the fungal protein source used in Quorn. Scientists at the University of Exeter are working with Quorn to understand how good it is for your muscles compared with animal-derived protein sources.
 
The team are comparing mycoprotein with milk protein, and have so far found it has “equivalent” bioavailability. This means important amino acids involved in muscle building become available in the blood after digesting the protein.
 
This could mean mycoprotein has equivalent muscle building properties to milk, supporting muscle growth in both younger and older people.

Exoplanet Explorer 360° Planetarium,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a tourist on another planet? Thanks to a collaboration between the University of Exeter Centre for Intermedia and Creative Technology, astrophysicist Dr Nathan Mayne and Cornish animation studio Engine House, you can now get pretty close…

Nathan’s fascination with the solar system started early, and his current research combines astrophysics and climate science in order to understand the atmospheres of planets orbiting distant stars, or exoplanets. After seeing Nathan on BBC’s Stargazing Live, Engine House got in touch to offer their expertise in creating visualisations of his research, and the result is the Exoplanet Explorer 360° Planetarium Video, created in partnership with University of Exeter and We the Curious (previously @Bristol Science Centre). The film takes the viewer on a scientifically accurate, virtual reality tour of six exoplanets, meaning you can surf the giant waves of Kepler-62e, and gaze across the lava fields of 55 Cancri e.

The film is now We the Curious’s most popular science video, with more than one million views. View the video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhLExhpXX0E

Reducing product design costs by 80 per cent with Centek,"Engineers at the University of Exeter worked with Newton Abbot-based Centek Group to significantly reduce costs and development times for new products into the oil and gas sector. 

Centralizers are vitally important for safety in the oil and gas industry, retaining casings centrally within boreholes and preventing leaks at the surface. Centralizers are often in demand at very short notice, with specific requirements depending on the drilling operation.

Existing methods for development of centralizers for demanding oil wells can take up to 12 weeks, and can cost several thousand pounds. Costs for delaying drilling operations are extremely large, and so short development time is especially valuable. Current design and test processes require several concurrent prototypes. Often, further refinements needed after testing can push the cost up further.

Using some of their high performance computers, Engineering staff at the University of Exeter have developed specialist modelling software and a surface response modelling tool which will drastically reduce the number of test cycles, and the total cost and time taken to get new products to customers. 

By working with the University of Exeter, Centek have demonstrated they can produce new product designs within one week and cut costs by up to 80 per cent.

This new design tool, which can run on a smart phone on site at an oil well, will not only increase profitability for the Devon-based manufacturer, but also safeguard quality jobs and help Centek Group beat international competition.",482,0,0,0,"manufacturing,centek,centraliser,pipe centraliser,oil industry,drilling,oil pipelines,newton abbot,exeter,university of exeter,exeter university,university,knowledge transfer partnership,ktp,innovate uk"

Reducing energy costs with Minibems,"Minibems are an incubation success story at the University of Exeter, having recruited talented students, met new prospects, developed test facilities with researchers and successfully raised funding.

The Exeter-based SME provides an efficient, intelligent heating system to complex buildings which dramatically reduces energy costs, improves resident services and shortens repair times.
In order to develop their product, Minibems needed to test their system in a suitable environment. University of Exeter staff identified a suitable location on Streatham Campus, with degree apprentices helping to fit out the space.

Minibems have also benefited from working with SETsquared Exeter: after presenting at a SETsquared showcase, representatives from EDF approached the company and have since provided office space and valuable advice.

Developing recyclable wetsuits with Finisterre,"There are more than 500,000 surfers in the United Kingdom who, on average, will replace their wetsuits once every two years. The result of this? The equivalent of more than thirty London double decker buses being discarded every year. Three hundred and eighty tonnes of non-biodegradable chemical-based waste, every single year.

As committed surfers, we all have a stack of old suits laying around somewhere. Whilst there are initiatives that exist around the down-cycling of old wetsuits, yoga mats and beer koozies fall short of producing a real solution.

“There have been some great advances in eco wetsuits and the search for alternatives to petroleum based neoprene, but the real elephant in the room for the watersports industry is what to do with a wetsuit at the end of its functional life. 

It’s a massive, global problem that we need to address; in this day and age there has to be a solution, and this is what we’re committed to finding. In the UK alone, surfers are replacing their suits on average every two years, with no real idea what to do with their old suits.” 
Tom Kay, Finisterre founder.

To address this problem and realising that it is a very specialist area, Finisterre approached the University of Exeter Centre for Alternative Materials and Remanufacturing (CALMARE). Through a two year Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) Finisterre has since appointed a full time Wetsuit Recycler, Jenny Banks, to work with Professor Oana Ghita and the staff at CALMARE looking at neoprene degradation and investigating re-manufacturing and circular economy initiatives.",1462,14,0,0,"finisterre,wetsuit,recycling,wetsuits from wetsuits,wetsuit recycling,wetsuit manufacture,neoprene,neoprene recycling,neoprene manufacturing,manufacturing,textiles,knowledge transfer partnership,ktp,st agnes,surfing,bodyboarding,cornwall,business,innovation,impact,university of exeter,exeter,tom kay,centre for alternative materials and remanufacturing,remanufacturing,alternative materials,engineering exeter,engineering,exeter university"
Improving preoperative assessments with Ultramed using MyPreOp,"Using online preoperative assessments could save the NHS £65 million per year, saving time for both nurses and patients. Ultramed, an SME developing online preoperative assessments, have worked with University of Exeter staff to gain funding and business support.

To help grow his business Dr Paul Upton retired early from the NHS to co-found Ultramed, but needed seed funding to help develop the MyPreOp program further. 

Working with the South West Centre of Excellence in Satellite Applications, Ultramed used seed funding to look for bigger grant opportunities and look to the next steps of their development.

In addition to receiving funding, Ultramed have benefited from University networks. By working with Crowdcube, a former tenant of the University’s Innovation Centre, the team raised their target within 2.5 days and were ultimately overfunded by 300 per cent. 

As a consequence, the future is looking bright for Ultramed and its innovative contribution to the NHS and wider health sector.",371,5,0,0,"yt:cc=on,ultramed,exeter,university,university of exeter,health,preoperative assessment,penryn,satellite catapult,business,innovation,impact,funding,nhs,healthcare,hospital,patient,hospital waiting times,business funding,South West Centre of Excellence in Satellite Applications,business cornwall,cornwall business,cornwall,mypreop,crowdcube,innovation centre,incubation"

Coastline Housing manage more than 4,300 houses in Cornwall, which carry a high demand for maintenance and management. Working with 350 customers through the Smartline project, Coastline is able to collect and share data with project partners to better understand how properties are used, and how their use could be improved. 

This information allows Coastline staff to understand whether properties are performing as expected, and to respond to maintenance issues more quickly. The Smartline project also enables communities to become more resilient to issues including damp, mould and fuel poverty, by allowing customers more insight into their properties and their own wellbeing.

Cornish businesses will also benefit from Smartline.

Helping identify plagiarism with Seedata,"A forensic linguistics project developed with the University of Exeter and Seedata could change the way plagiarism is detected in academia.

Plagiarism is a global issue for universities, and by using existing processes it can take up to a week for lecturers to detect issues with inconsistent results.

Dr Kate Harrington, a University of Exeter academic, worked with the Innovation, Impact and Business team to create new software which detects inauthentic authorship. By using forensic linguistic techniques, the software detects an author’s writing style and looks for consistency with previous works. Using this process, lecturers can then establish whether a student’s essays are written with the same ‘writing signature’ as their previous work.

Seedata, an Exeter-based SME and Science Park tenant, have worked with the University to commercialise the IP and reduce the time taken to 4 seconds.

In addition to developing the idea, the new IP and software could lead to exciting business opportunities for Seedata.",200,2,0,0,"exeter university,university of exeter,exeter,university,seedata,science park,innovation,incubation,business,data,plagiarism,business development,academia,copying,impact,forensic,linguistics,language,sme,intellectual property"

A Year of Trump: What happened — and what’s next?,"One year to the day since Donald Trump won the presidency, a journalist with the inside track on the White House offers an expert take on where we are, how we got here and what happens next.

Niall Stanage will offer a behind-the-scenes account of what it’s like to cover an administration like no other, from working in the now-infamous White House briefing room to prising information out of sources close to the president.

Stanage will also look at the big issues: Will the voters who put Trump in the White House stick with him? Are the boundaries that Trump loves to transgress gone forever? Have the Democrats found someone who can beat him? And what we can expect now in Britain, Europe and beyond?

Belfast-born Niall Stanage is the White House Columnist with The Hill, the political website and newspaper based in Washington, D.C. He is also a frequent TV commentator on both sides of the Atlantic, most often for Sky News, the BBC and MSNBC. He has lived in the United States since 2003, covering four presidential elections. On Election Night 2016, he was at Trump headquarters, watching the biggest shock in modern political history unfold. 

His reported column from the White House, “The Memo,” appears several times a week and has become vital reading for political insiders.

Niall is also the author of “Redemption Song,” a critically-acclaimed Irish bestseller about Barack Obama’s quest for the White House.

Climate Science following the Paris Agreement: What Next?,"The impacts of climate change are already evident both in the UK and worldwide, through changes in extreme weather, diminishing snow and ice and rising sea levels.

The Paris agreement in December 2015 marked a turning point in climate negotiations with 195 governments agreeing to take global action to tackle climate change.

As a result, the focus of climate science research at the Met Office has changed to reflect these changing drivers: moving from proving that climate change is happening to understanding the nature of the change.

Robust, impartial and targeted climate science is needed to manage the risks of climate change, including developing strategies for lowering greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for the changes to our climate which are unavoidable.

Professor Stephen Belcher
Stephen Belcher is the Met Office Chief Scientist and provides leadership of our scientific research and development.
The Met Office team of more than 500 research scientists has earned a world-wide reputation for excellence in weather and climate science and the translation of this science into weather and climate services for daily weather forecasts, emergency response (for example to volcanic eruptions), and into climate change mitigation and adaptation.

As Chief Scientist, Stephen has overall responsibility for the leadership and management of the Met Office’s scientific programme, by providing strategic direction, ensuring high quality delivery and nurturing scientific excellence.

He represents the Met Office on science and research technology to UK Government, ensuring that the Met Office science programme fits properly into the wider UK environmental science landscape.",504,12,0,1,"Climage Change,Global Warming,Met Office,Paris Agreement,Climate Science,Environment"

Can we live with a warmer planet?,"Can we live with a warmer planet?

Hosted by the High-End cLimate Impacts and eXtremes research project (HELIX) on 4 October 2017. 

Featuring a distinguished panel of project scientists and stakeholders, hear about our findings and discussion of what they could mean for our future.

Our panel include:

Panel Chair: Astrid Wissenburg, Director of Research Services, University of Exeter; 
Andrea Tilche, Head of Unit: Climate Action and Earth Observation, European Commission;
Scientists from the HELIX team, including Richard Betts, Project Director.

The Paris Agreement set a target of holding global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.

However, it is clear that this is a huge challenge. Some suggest that despite our efforts, it will not be achieved.

We therefore need a clear idea of what the world could look like above these levels of warming. Although communities, governments and businesses across the globe are working to avoid extreme climate change, they are also increasingly planning to adapt to unavoidable changes.

HELIX addressed this by bringing together scientists from leading institutes to understand how climate change could affect the natural and human environments.

The HELIX team have calculated a range of impacts at 1.5°C, 2°C, 4°C, and 6°C global warming, to help us understand the risks we need to avoid and manage those that are already unavoidable.

Meet our Honorary Graduates - Peter Lacey,"Following an undistinguished education at Ilminster Grammar School, Peter was admitted to the School of Architecture of Bristol College of Advanced Technology, almost immediately to become the University of Bath, where he gained the University's first 1st class honours degree in architecture.

After qualifying in 1969 he joined MWT Architects in Plymouth where he was given responsibility for their more prestigious projects. This led to the opportunity four years later to open a new office in Exeter, which quickly became the largest south-west of Bristol. At the age of 31 he became a partner.

Expansion of MWT, incorporation and ultimately listing on the AIMs market, followed by acquisitions, created one of the largest UK architectural practices with over 500 staff. Flotation less than a week after Black Monday (1987) and the subsequent recession took its toll on listed architectural companies and the company went into receivership in 1992.

Peter structured a management buy-out of the south-west offices which he chaired until his retirement in 2005 and was non-exec chair until 2010. It continues today as LHC Architects.

In 2004 he was invited to join the Council of the University of Exeter and in 2007 was elected as a Pro-Chancellor serving until 2016. During his career he has been branch and regional chair of the Royal Institute of British Architects and served on its National Council.

Building partnerships to protect fish stocks,"University of Exeter research into the effect of warming oceans on fish stocks and the future shape of fisheries has led to a ground-breaking research partnership that is changing the way we fish.
Following a workshop, organised by the University of Exeter’s Professor Simpson, looking at how our fisheries might be in the year 2050, a new Community Interest company was borne which is developing a new approach to sustainable fishing.

Sole of Discretion works with fishers who use smaller boats, static nets and hand line fishing techniques. The company pays these fishers a fair price for the fish they land, rewarding fishers to catch fish in more sustainable ways.

Research from Professor Simpson, an Associate Professor in Marine Biology and Global Change, has fed into the approach taken by Sole of Discretion. Fishing is done with as much environmental sensitivity as possible, taking into account changes in fish stocks brought about by warming waters and using fishing methods that reduce by-catch and limit impacts to the environment.
The Sole of Discretion fishers are monitored by students from the University to ensure they are using the best possible fishing methods, also allowing the students to gather valuable data for use in their research.",250,1,0,0,

A new approach to sustainable fisheries,"This new approach to sustainable fishing ensures fish and other seafood are being sustainably caught with minimal damage to the marine environment.

University of Exeter academics and students have been working with a new community interest company to develop an alternative approach to supplying sustainable fish.

Sole of Discretion works with fishers who use smaller boats, static nets and hand-line fishing techniques, which help protect fish stocks and cause less environmental damage. The company pays these fishers a fair price for the fish they land making sure it doesn't pay for them to fish is a less sustainable way.

This new approach is supported by research into the environmental impact of fishing from Exeter's Professor Steve Simpson, Associate Professor in Marine Biology and Global Change.

The collaboration came about after an event, organised by Professor Simpson, that brought together fishing industry representatives, from restaurant owners to trawler men, to develop a positive future for fisheries in 2050. Following this event Caroline Bennett, owner of Moshi Moshi sushi restaurant founded sole of discretion and began working with Professor Simpson and his students to develop an alternative to traditional fishing where the fishermen are rewarded for being environmentally sensitive.

South Cloisters opening,"A dramatic overhaul to a former hall of residence at St Luke’s has created a modern, high quality research and education facility on the University’s campus.

The high-quality refurbishment involved an extension and a new storey added to the building. It is now home to the Medical School’s Medical Imaging programme, which is routinely named as the best of its kind in the country, and also to the world-leading Institute of Health Research.

Many of these researchers are part of the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC), a £10 million partnership which spans Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, encompassing universities in the South West and the NHS. Under the directorship of Professor Stuart Logan, PenCLAHRC supports research with direct impact on patients' health and on improvements to the way in which NHS care is delivered.

The investment has secured new high quality student learning and study spaces available to everyone at St Luke’s, representing a significant upgrade to facilities.

Inaugural lecture and Piano Recital  - Professor Slobodan Djordjevic,"Recent flood events have caused deaths, displacement of people and have had enormous (mostly adverse) direct and indirect impacts. Projections of climate change and of urban growth indicate that the frequency and intensity of floods will increase in many regions, especially in big cities. 

The complexities of natural, technological and socio-economic aspects of flooding make it a fascinating and essential research subject. How do we simulate the flow in drainage networks and between buildings? If we forecast rainfall over the next three hours or next three decades, what can we predict based on such forecasts? What’s the probability that a child playing in flood water mixed with raw sewage will catch a diarrhoeal disease? 

How can deterministic and probabilistic models be merged intelligently? How can resilience to extreme weather events of different kind be evaluated in an integrated manner? How should we educate students, politicians and the public? The challenges to answering the above questions will be discussed in this talk. 

Research on flooding and playing music both require imaginative and technical skills. Disasters bring misery and stress, whereas art makes our lives rich.

The research has driven a fundamental re-appraisal of how children with SEN should be taught, showing that many children with SEN do not require specialist teaching, but rather an intensification of the same general teaching methods used for non-SEN pupils. 

The research has resulted in the creation of a practical training tool for SEN teaching and a teacher-training tool designed on this basis has been disseminated nationally to teacher training providers.

International security: is it as bad as it seems?,"Dr Jamie Shea, Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security Challenges at NATO.

Jamie delivered this lecture on 20 November 2014 in the Alumni Auditorium at the University of Exeter.

Introduction by Professor Steve McCorriston, Q&A chaired by Professor Doug Stokes.

Lecture summary:

Recent events have given many people the impression that the world is sliding into disorder and in some places (such as the Middle East) even anarchy. 

Certainly, security challenges appear to be impacting on the NATO countries faster, and in less tractable forms, than in recent decades when NATO was able to deal more or less with one major challenge at a time; be it Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan or Libya. 
Now the Alliance has to return to its core task of collective territorial defence in Eastern Europe, vis-à-vis a resurgent Russia, while being ready for more crisis management and defence capacity-building in the Middle East and North Africa to help the fragile states in these regions cope with the challenge of the Islamic State and other Jihadist movements. 

When challenges are multiple, gaining consensus among Allies on the priorities (such as the East versus the South) will not be easy.  Moreover, the new challenges come at a time when NATO’s defence budgets have been in sharp decline while many other countries in the world have been rediscovering an appetite for military power and modernization. 

So is this the twilight of the West as many have predicted? 
Are the challenges from a return of geo-politics or the general breakdown of governance in the South so formidable as to overwhelm NATO’s capacity to cope? 

Is there a way through this tangled web of threats and instabilities that could return the Euro Atlantic region to some semblance of order and predictable inter-state relations in the years ahead, even if it is not the cooperative community of liberal democracies that we dreamed of 25 years ago, when the Berlin Wall came down?

Running geese give insight into low oxygen tolerance,"A new study led by the University of Exeter into how the world's highest flying bird, the bar-headed goose, is able to survive at extreme altitudes may have future implications for low oxygen medical conditions in humans.

Dr Lucy Hawkes and colleagues tested how good the geese were at coping with exercise in reduced oxygen environments by simulating the conditions of Mount Everest in a clear box and then getting the birds to run on a treadmill inside the box. They discovered that the geese had a remarkable tolerance of low oxygen conditions at levels that would render most humans completely immobile.

The wider implications are for low oxygen medical conditions in humans such as heart attack and stroke -- suggesting what adaptations might help prevent problems in the first place and learning how animals have managed to cope with really extreme environments.
